1.0 Intro To Latex
===============================================================================

    Latex is document preparation system. It's different than the "what you see
    is what you get", also known as WYSIWYG, programs like traditional
    Microsoft Word and Open Office. Latex is written and compiled to get the
    document. It's very popular in the academic setting and is used in lots of
    workplaces. Programmers like it because it's just like writing code, and
    can be used with version control.


2.0 Latex Editors

    My favorite Latex editor is TexMaker. It's free, cross-platform, and works
    really well. You can find it at the following link:

    Once installed, simply open the files and start editing. Click "Quick
    Build" near the top-middle of the program to build the document. If
    successful, it should show up on the right side of the program in the PDF
    viewer.
